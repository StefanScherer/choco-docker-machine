# Maintainer's Guide

This document explains how to maintain the Chocolatey package
for docker-machine for Windows.

## How it works

This Chocolatey package is designed to download the docker-machine
client binary (.exe) and place it in `%PATH%`.

Main installation script is written in PowerShell and is in
`tools\chocolateyInstall.ps1`.

## Setting up development environment.

1. Install Chocolatey (http://chocolatey.org) on your
   Windows machine.
3. Clone this repository.

## Making a new release

#### 1. Update `docker.nuspec`

You need to update the value in `<version>` tag with
the official docker-machine version string correctly.

#### 2. Update `tools\chocolateyInstall.ps1`

You need to update `$url`, `$url64`, `$checksum` and `$checksum64`
variables below.

* You can get the urls and checksums from the "release" tab at
  https://github.com/docker/machine/releases

Example:

$url            = 'https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.2.0/docker-machine_windows-386.exe'
$checksum       = 'c7c957dd0e8ce34a1cedc752447e217e'
$url64          = 'https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.2.0/docker-machine_windows-amd64.exe'
$checksum64     = '5e8935f6ab2f6627b4163cb4c68191ef'

#### 3. Package it

Open a command line window and run the following command in the folder
where `docker.nuspec` exists:

    `cpack`

It might show some warnings, but if there's no errors, it's completed.
Check if a `.nupkg` file exists in the same directory after this.

#### 4. Install it locally

First, make sure `docker-machine` is not installed (or not in %PATH%). (Cleanest
way to do this is to run inside a clean virtual machine but that's not
always necessary).

Use the following command in powershell to install the nupkg locally, assuming
you're currently in the :

    choco install docker-machine -source $pwd

> NOTE: If the version is pre-release (e.g. a RC), you need to provide
> `-pre` flag to the command above as well.

The command above must be installing docker-machine correctly. Run `docker-machine -v`
to verify if it is installed.

Run the following commands to verify uninstallation works:

    choco uninstall docker-machine
    docker-machine // shouldn't work

#### 5. Push the package

You need your API key to push Chocolatey packages.
Go to http://chocolatey.org and log in.

Go to your account settings and show your API key.

Copy the example command with your key

    choco apiKey -k your-api-key -source https://chocolatey.org/

Push the package

    choco push docker-machine.0.5.0.nupkg

While in moderation you can push the package again to fix errors in the description or installation script etc.

#### 6. Approval Process

If you are submitting a stable version, Chocolatey moderators need to
allow the package before it is published. This usually takes a day or
so. (If it takes any longer, ping @ferventcoder).

If a package is **pre-release** (i.e. has `-rc1`, `-beta` like strings
in its version) then the submission **does not need moderator approval**
and you will see a message like this:

> "*This package is exempt from moderation. While it is likely safe for you,
> there is more risk involved.*"

The difference is, users install stable packages with:

    choco install docker-machine

and pre-release packages with:

    choco install docker-machine -pre

command and Chocolatey usually prompts users with more confirmation
messages if the package is pre-release.

#### 7. Profit

Package will be published at https://chocolatey.org/packages/docker-machine
